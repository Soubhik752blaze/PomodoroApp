# Pomodoro App

Welcome to the Pomodoro App! This application is built using ReactJS and helps you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: A 25-minute work timer.
- **Short Break Timer**: A 5-minute break timer.
- **Long Break Timer**: A 15-minute break timer.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for the end of each session and break.
